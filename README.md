# Deep_Learning
This repository contains the assignment submission(code and reports) which I did as a part of Deep Learning course at my university.

There are two folders 'code' and 'Reports'. 
1. code - Has the Jupyter notebooks of the respective assignments. Few lines of code in data loading methods are removed for privacy. So, it might not be possible to execute some notebooks.
2. Reports - contains the pdf files of the reports which were submitted.

Assignment 1 - Neural Networks 
Assignment 2 - Convolutional Neural Network 
Assignment 3 - Sequence Models ( A simple sequence model, Elman, RNN, LSTM) 
Assignment 4 - GANs and VAEs

Mostly the datasets used are standard such as IMDB, MNIST, CIFAR10, Imagenette.

Package - Pytorch
